# ig-autopilot

Schedule and auto-publish Instagram posts through Instagram's **official** Graph API, with captions drafted by Claude — running for free on GitHub Actions. No server, no third-party scheduler, no sketchy browser bots that risk your account.

- 🗓️ **Schedule** posts by dropping entries in a JSON queue
- 📸 **Autopilot** — drop a photo in `media/`, push, and Claude *looks* at it, writes the caption, and schedules it on your cadence
- 💬 **Auto-replies** to comments on your posts, in brand voice — skips trolls and spam, never invents shipping answers
- 🔭 **Morning engagement briefing** — finds the best posts in your niche and pre-writes a comment for each; you post them by hand in 10 minutes (human-paced, so zero ban risk)
- 🎨 **Content factory** — writes fresh one-liners in your voice and renders them as branded statement cards, so the queue never runs dry (and the lines that pop off become your next cap designs)
- 🤖 **Draft captions** in your brand voice with the Anthropic API
- ✅ **Official API only** — the same Content Publishing API that Buffer and Later use, so there's no shadowban risk
- 💸 **Free** — GitHub Actions runs the cron; you only pay for Claude tokens (fractions of a cent per caption)
- 👀 **Review-first by default** — content lives as files, so a pull request *is* your approval step

## Example output

Statement cards rendered by the content factory (`examples/` has more):

<p>
  <img src="examples/card-01.jpg" width="240" alt="i don't have exes, i have case studies">
  <img src="examples/card-02.jpg" width="240" alt="confidence is just delusion with better lighting">
  <img src="examples/card-06.jpg" width="240" alt="i retired at 27. my linkedin just says resting.">
</p>

The autopilot does the same for your own photos — writing a one-liner in your
voice and placing it in clear space so it never covers your face.

---

## Quick start — the whole thing in one folder

Once setup is done (below), your entire job is this:

1. Drop selfies into **`media/`** (drag them onto the folder on github.com, or `git push`).
2. That's it.

For each new photo, Claude writes a one-liner in your voice, burns it onto the
image in your brand font (placed in clear space, never on your face), reuses that
line as the caption, and schedules it. Already-posted photos are skipped by
filename, so you just keep adding — new selfies daily, no cleanup. See
[`media/README.md`](./media/README.md) for the folder rules.

Nothing waits for you unless you set `AUTOPILOT_REVIEW=true`.

## How it works

```
content/queue.json   →   src/publish.js   →   Instagram Graph API
   (you edit)          (runs on cron in         (container → publish)
                        GitHub Actions)
```

Every 30 minutes a GitHub Action checks the queue for posts whose `publish_at` time has passed and publishes them, then commits the updated status back to the repo. Captions can be drafted ahead of time with `src/generate.js`.

## ⚠️ Read this before you start

Three hard requirements from Meta — none are optional:

1. **Your account must be a Business account.** Instagram's API only works with professional accounts, and content publishing is safest on **Business** specifically (Creator support for publishing is inconsistent). Convert in the Instagram app: Settings → Account type → Switch to Business. You'll link it to a Facebook Page in the process.

2. **Media must be at a public, direct file URL.** Instagram *fetches* your image/video from a URL — it can't read files from this repo directly. **Google Drive, Dropbox, and iCloud links do NOT work** (they return web pages, not files). Use a **Supabase public Storage bucket** (recommended — free, direct URLs), Cloudinary, or S3.

3. **Claude writes captions, not your photos.** Your hats need real product photos that you supply. The AI handles captions, hashtags, hooks, and scheduling — the words, not the pictures.

**The good news:** because you're only posting to *your own* account, you do **not** need Meta's 2–4 week App Review. That only applies to apps posting on behalf of *other* people. Solo, self-owned automation runs in "development mode" with you as the sole user.

---

## One-time setup (~30–45 min)

### 1. Get your Instagram credentials from Meta

1. Go to [developers.facebook.com](https://developers.facebook.com) → **My Apps** → **Create App** → type **Business**.
2. Add the **Instagram** product to the app.
3. Connect your Instagram Business account and its linked Facebook Page.
4. Generate a **long-lived access token** with the `instagram_business_basic` and `instagram_business_content_publish` scopes — and add `instagram_business_manage_comments` if you want the auto-reply agent. (Meta's Graph API Explorer or the app's token tool will do this. Short-lived tokens can be exchanged for long-lived ones that last ~60 days.)
5. Grab your **Instagram user ID** (numeric) — you can query it from the Graph API Explorer.

> **Token longevity tip:** long-lived tokens expire in ~60 days. Either run `npm run refresh-token` every ~50 days (and update the secret), or — the low-maintenance path — create a **Meta System User** and issue a **non-expiring** token, then you never touch it again.

### 2. Set up media hosting (Supabase, recommended)

1. In your Supabase project, create a **public** Storage bucket, e.g. `hats`.
2. Upload a photo. Its public URL looks like
   `https://<project>.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/hats/olive.jpg`.
3. Use that URL as `media_url` in the queue. (Or set `MEDIA_BASE_URL` and use short relative paths.)

### 3. Configure the repo

**For local testing:**
```bash
cp .env.example .env      # then fill in the values
npm run dry-run           # shows what WOULD publish, posts nothing
```

**For GitHub Actions (the real deployment):**
Repo → **Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions**:

| Secret | Value |
|---|---|
| `IG_USER_ID` | your numeric IG user ID |
| `IG_ACCESS_TOKEN` | your long-lived token |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | from console.anthropic.com (only for caption generation) |

Optional **Variables** (not secret): `IG_API_VERSION`, `MEDIA_BASE_URL`, `ANTHROPIC_MODEL`.

That's it — the `Publish due Instagram posts` workflow now runs every 30 minutes.

## Usage

### Schedule a post
Add an entry to `content/queue.json`:
```json
{
  "id": "2026-07-15-corduroy",
  "status": "scheduled",
  "publish_at": "2026-07-15T17:00:00Z",
  "media_type": "IMAGE",
  "media_url": "https://<project>.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/hats/olive.jpg",
  "caption": "The corduroy one is finally here. ..."
}
```
- `publish_at` is **ISO 8601 in UTC** (the `Z`). 17:00 UTC ≈ 10am PT / 7pm Berlin.
- `status` must be `"scheduled"` to go out. Use `"draft"` while you're still editing.
- `media_type`: `IMAGE`, `REELS`, or `CAROUSEL`.

Commit it. Because it's a git commit (or PR), you get a clean review + audit trail. When the time passes, it publishes and the status flips to `published`.

### Or: just drop a photo in `media/` (autopilot)

The laziest workflow, and the best one:

```bash
cp ~/Desktop/olive-corduroy.jpg media/
git add media/ && git commit -m "new hat pics" && git push
```

On push, a GitHub Action sends each **new** photo to Claude, which *looks at the image* (vision), writes a caption + hashtags + alt text in your `brand.json` voice, and schedules it into the next open slot on your cadence (default **Mon/Wed/Fri at 17:00 UTC** — set `POST_DAYS` and `POST_TIME_UTC` repo Variables to change). The publisher posts it when the time comes. Cost: roughly a cent per caption.

Rules of the road:
- **JPEG only** (`.jpg`/`.jpeg`) — Instagram's API doesn't accept other image formats. Keep files under ~4 MB.
- **The repo must be public** for zero-config hosting (Instagram fetches the image from the repo's raw URL). Private repo? Set `MEDIA_BASE_URL` to a public bucket that mirrors `media/` instead.
- Photos already queued are skipped automatically, so the folder can just accumulate.
- Want an approval step? Set the repo Variable `AUTOPILOT_REVIEW=true` (or run `npm run autopilot -- --review` locally) and posts land as `draft` for you to flip to `scheduled`.

### Draft captions with Claude
```bash
npm run generate -- "launch week, new corduroy hat, cozy fall vibe" --variants 3
```
Prints 3 caption options. Add `--append` to drop the first into the queue as a draft. Edit `brand.json` to tune the voice — it's the single source of truth for tone, audience, and do's/don'ts.

You can also trigger this from the **Actions** tab (the `Generate captions` workflow) without touching a terminal.

### Auto-reply to comments (the engagement agent)

Twice an hour, the reply workflow scans your recent posts for new comments and answers them in your brand voice — playful thanks for compliments, jokes back at jokes. It skips trolls, spam, and your own comments, and if someone asks something it can't verifiably answer (price, shipping, restocks) it points them to the link in bio instead of inventing an answer. Reply speed is a genuine ranking signal, and this makes the account feel alive at any follower count.

- Needs the `instagram_business_manage_comments` scope on your token.
- **Start with the repo Variable `REPLY_DRY_RUN=true`** — it logs what it *would* say in the Actions output without posting anything. Flip it off once the voice feels right.
- Every handled comment is recorded in `content/replied.json`, so nothing is ever answered twice.
- Test locally with `npm run reply-dry-run`. Don't want the feature at all? Delete `.github/workflows/reply.yml`.

### Fully autonomous mode (no photos, no review)

Out of the box, nothing waits for a human: the review switches (`AUTOPILOT_REVIEW`, `REPLY_DRY_RUN`) are opt-in training wheels — leave them unset and the machine runs itself.

Every morning at 06:00 UTC the **content factory** checks how many future posts are queued. If it's below target (default 7, tune with `REFILL_TARGET_POSTS`), it asks Claude for fresh one-liners in your `brand.json` voice — checked against every line ever used in `content/lines.json` so it never repeats — renders each as a 1080×1350 statement card (rotating colorways, your handle as watermark), and hands them to the autopilot to caption and schedule. The queue literally cannot run dry.

Your real photos still slot in whenever you drop them in `media/` — the factory only tops up the gap. Watch which generated lines get the most saves and comments: those are your next embroidered caps. The content engine doubles as product research.

Note: card rendering is the repo's one dependency (`sharp`); the refill workflow installs it automatically. All other scripts remain dependency-free.

### Morning engagement briefing (the scout)

Every morning at 9am Berlin time, the scout reads the **top posts** under your niche hashtags (Instagram's official, read-only hashtag API), has Claude pick the ~10 best targets, and pre-writes a comment for each in your voice. It commits a briefing to `content/engage/YYYY-MM-DD.md` with links and copy-paste-ready comments.

Then the human part: 10 minutes, from your phone. Open link → post the comment (or riff on it) → next. Skip anything that doesn't feel right. Because every action is you, at human pace, from the real app, there is **nothing for Instagram to detect** — this is just you being good at comments, faster.

Why the comments are written the way they are: never salesy, no brand plugs, no links. A genuinely funny comment gets profile taps; a promotional one gets reported. The joke *is* the marketing.

- Set `SCOUT_HASHTAGS` (repo Variable) to your niche, e.g. `nocap,dadhat,datingmemes`. Keep it to ~4–6: Instagram allows 30 *unique* hashtags per rolling week (querying the same ones daily is fine).
- Targets already suggested are tracked in `content/scouted.json` and never repeated.
- Don't want it? Delete `.github/workflows/scout.yml`.

**What this repo deliberately does NOT include:** bots that auto-like, auto-comment, or auto-follow other accounts. There's no official API for that; the unofficial routes impersonate the mobile app, violate Instagram's terms, and are the most common way small brand accounts get action-blocked or banned. The scout gives you the same reach mechanic with a human hand on every action.

### Media types cheat sheet
| Type | Requirements |
|---|---|
| **Image** | JPEG, aspect ratio 4:5 → 1.91:1, ≤ 8 MB, sRGB |
| **Reel** | MP4/MOV, 9:16, 5–90 seconds, H.264/HEVC |
| **Carousel** | 2–10 items; all cropped to the **first** item's aspect ratio |

Captions: ≤ 2,200 characters. Instagram does **not** render markdown/bold in captions.

## Good to know

- **Rate limit:** 100 API-published posts per rolling 24 hours. Carousels count as one. You will never hit this.
- **Cron isn't to-the-minute.** GitHub's scheduler is best-effort and can lag a few minutes (or, rarely, skip a slot under heavy load). Perfect for social; not for a countdown launch. Publish anything "due," don't rely on exact timing.
- **Inactive repos pause schedules.** GitHub disables scheduled workflows after 60 days with no repo activity. The auto-commit on each publish keeps it awake; a monthly manual run also does.
- **Stories & some sticker features** aren't fully supported by the publishing API. This tool focuses on feed images, carousels, and Reels.

## Want a dashboard instead of JSON?

This repo is deliberately minimal (one dependency, files-as-database). If you'd rather have a Next.js + Supabase UI with a calendar, a draft-approval queue, and Vercel Cron doing the scheduling, that's a natural next version — the Graph API client in `src/instagram.js` drops straight in.
